## Weather API using OpenWeatherMap
This is a simple JavaScript program that fetches and displays weather information for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

# Setup
To use this program, you'll need an API key from OpenWeatherMap. You can sign up for a free account here to get an API key.

Once you have an API key, replace YOUR_API_KEY in the getWeatherData function with your actual API key.

# Usage
To run the program, open the index.html file in your web browser. Enter the name of a city in the input field and click the "Get Weather" button. The program will fetch the current weather data for the specified city and display it on the page.
